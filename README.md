A Comparative analysis of classical Machine learning methods with CNN and Transfer learning methods to identify Tomato Leaf Viral diseases
This study presents a comparative analysis of classical machine learning techniques, CNN and Advanced deep learning methods in the early detection of four tomato viral diseases, namely, Tomato yellow leaf curl virus, tomato mosaic virus, tomato septoria leaf spot and tomato target spot.  This paper shows a comparative analysis of algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, CNN, Transfer learning Mobile Net and ResNet-50 to identify the tomato leaf viral diseases and found that Transfer learning algorithms were able to detect the diseases with more accuracy.
